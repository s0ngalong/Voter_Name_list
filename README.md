# Voter_Name_list
Keeps an entry of voter names and is able to be searched

## demonstration of the program
Done as a school project I have created a way to collect names and than allow an authorized user to search for them. There is a single background music and a few other sounds for granting access or denying access. A logging system is also created to log when someone has logged in and which user has attempted the password.
